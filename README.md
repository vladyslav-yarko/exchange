    ```
    uv python pin {version} # 3.12 version by default
    ```
    To change version below **3.10** you will need to change field **required-python** in **pyproject.toml** file
    and after to do command upper

4. **Database setup**

5. **.pem keys setup**
   - For authorization and authentication on api you need to create public and private keys for jwt tokens
   - Make sure that you have openssl installed
    ```
    mkdir backend/src/keys
    ```
    ```
    openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out backend/src/keys/private_key.pem
    ```
    ```
    openssl rsa -in backend/src/keys/private_key.pem -pubout -out backend/src/keys/public_key.pem
    ```

6. **Backend setup**
   - Change current directory to "backend"
    ```
    cd backend
    ```
   - Install all mock data for database
    ```
    python -m scripts.db.data
    ```
    or:
    ```
    uv run python -m scripts.db.data
    ```

7. **Backend Launch**
   - To run app use
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
    or:
    ```
    uv run python main.py
    ```

8. **Backend logs checking**      
   - In **logs** folder you will find logs file for backend

9.  **Frontend setup**
   - You need to open another shell and change directory to **frontend**
   - Make sure that you have node installed
